Cards as we know them originated in Europe. We traditionally think of cards as
only being clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, but there are also some other

Wiki "Playing Card Suits". The nifty thing about these extra card decks, is
that we can make a double deck of cards, and use the suit culture to tell the
